# YouTube OAuth "Access Blocked" Error - Fix Guide

## Error: "YouTube Automation has not completed the Google verification process"

This happens because the app is using OAuth credentials that are in **Testing mode**. Here are your options:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Users Must Create Their Own OAuth Credentials

**You CANNOT share OAuth credentials with users.** Each user must create their own credentials.

### Why?
- Google OAuth credentials are tied to YOUR Google Cloud account
- Sharing them violates Google's Terms of Service
- Users will get "Access Blocked" errors unless they're on YOUR test user list
- The app needs to authenticate with THEIR YouTube channel, not yours

---

## Solution: Users Create Their Own Credentials

### Step 1: Follow the Setup Guide

Users must complete the full OAuth setup from `API_SETUP_GUIDE.md`:

1. Create their own Google Cloud Project
2. Enable YouTube Data API v3
3. Configure OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Download their own `client_secrets.json`

**This is the ONLY way for the app to work properly.**

## For Repository Owner: Update Documentation

Add this to your README.md:

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: OAuth Credentials

**DO NOT** try to use shared OAuth credentials. Each user MUST create their own credentials.

### Why You Need Your Own Credentials:
- OAuth credentials are personal and tied to your Google Cloud account
- The app will authenticate with YOUR YouTube channel
- You have full control over API quotas and billing
- Complies with Google's Terms of Service

### Setup Instructions:
Follow the complete guide in [API_SETUP_GUIDE.md](API_SETUP_GUIDE.md) to create your own credentials.
```

## Alternative: If You Want to Add Test Users (Not Recommended for Public Repos)

If you want to allow a few specific users to test with YOUR credentials:

### Add Test Users in Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **OAuth consent screen**
4. Scroll down to **Test users** section
5. Click **+ ADD USERS**
6. Enter the Gmail addresses of users you want to allow
7. Click **SAVE**

**Limitations:**
- Maximum 100 test users
- Users must use the exact Gmail address you added
- Only works while your app is in Testing mode
- Not suitable for public distribution

---

## For Production: Submit for Verification (Complex Process)

If you want anyone to use your app without being a test user:

### 1. Prepare for Verification

- Add privacy policy URL
- Add terms of service URL
- Complete all required OAuth consent screen fields
- Prepare detailed explanation of why you need YouTube upload scope
- Record a demo video showing how your app works

### 2. Submit for Verification

1. In OAuth consent screen, click **PUBLISH APP**
2. Click **PREPARE FOR VERIFICATION**
3. Fill out the verification questionnaire
4. Submit application

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: 
- Verification can take **4-6 weeks**
- YouTube upload scope requires **extensive justification**
- Google may reject the application
- You'll need a privacy policy and terms of service

## Recommended Approach for This Repository

**Best practice for open-source projects:**

### Make Users Create Their Own Credentials

**Advantages:**
‚úÖ No verification needed
‚úÖ Users control their own quotas
‚úÖ No sharing of sensitive credentials
‚úÖ Complies with Google TOS
‚úÖ Users authenticate with their own YouTube channel

**How to implement:**

1. Clear documentation in README
2. Step-by-step guide (already in API_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
3. Remove any `client_secrets.json` from repository
4. Add `client_secrets.json` to `.gitignore`
5. Add setup instructions to README

---

## Quick Fix Summary

### For Users:
**Create your own OAuth credentials following API_SETUP_GUIDE.md**

### For Developer (You):
**Update README to make it clear users need their own credentials**

---

## Sample README Section

Add this to your main README.md:

```markdown
## üîê Authentication Setup Required

This application requires you to create your own API credentials. You CANNOT use shared credentials.

### Required APIs:
1. **OpenAI API** - For Sora video generation
2. **Google Gemini API** - For content generation  
3. **YouTube Data API v3** - For video uploads (requires OAuth setup)

### Setup Time: ~15-20 minutes

Follow the detailed guide: [API_SETUP_GUIDE.md](API_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: You must create your own `client_secrets.json` file for YouTube authentication. This cannot be shared between users.
```

---

## Technical Explanation

The error occurs because:

1. Your OAuth app is in **Testing mode** (not Published)
2. Google restricts Testing mode apps to developer-approved testers only
3. Users trying to authenticate are not on your test user list
4. Publishing requires Google verification (difficult for YouTube upload scope)

**The solution**: Each user creates their own OAuth credentials, so they're the developer of their own instance.

**Bottom Line**: For open-source repositories, always have users create their own OAuth credentials. It's simpler, safer, and compliant with Google's policies.
